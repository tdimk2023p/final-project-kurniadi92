This project will compare Bahasa Consonant Centric Keyboard layout with Colemak and Qwerty keyboard. This research aimed better keyboard layout for mobile usage which most of the time will skip vocal character and use consonant only to type faster.

Research Question : 
-  Can we design keyboard layout with mobile characteristic in mind for Bahasa short message spesific usage ?
- How we decide all alphabet position ?
- How the keyboard will performed compared to QWERTY ?
- How the keyboard will performed compared to Colemak ?
- Is user comfortable with the new keyboard ?

We use QWERTY and Colemak as comparator, because QWERTY is the most wide usage keyboard layout in the world and Colemak is the newest (and claimed as faster than QWERTY).

Methodology :
- Bahasa word acquired from this github https://github.com/lufias69/KBBI2/blob/master/cek_KBBI/dataKBBI.json. Then processed such as remove all A,I,U,E,O. Then count every consonant used for the whole dataset. Result : n,r,m,k,g,t,s,l,b,p,d,h,y,c,j,w,f,v,z,x,q
- User will test on 3 keyboards, first with colemak, then qwerty and lastly with our proposed layout. We track every user interaction with keyboard
- User will fill survey with 5 likert scale to know more about their experience
- User will send all tracked result to google realtime database
- We analyze Result

Subject of test :
- 13 Iphone User
- 5 Female, 13 Male
- QWERTY fluent user and have daily interaction with mobile keyboard
- Aged 15 until 40
- Female and Male

Result :
Our proposed keyboard work still can match dvorak performance but cannot match QWERTY keyboard performance
